# Why are we doing this?

The reason for this post's existence is to encourage more teams to make the
effort of transitioning to a proper secrets storage to store their credentials,
certificates and other relevant *files* - think `bbl up`.

Most of us are guilty of taking the easy way out by checking in all our
secrets and certs into a private git repo .  And although we install tools
like the [cred-alert-cli git
hook](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/git-hooks-core/blob/70f9b7dcd4b7ea0617a57d66f23c5716e2028f8e/README.md#installing-cred-alert-cli)
to keep us in check, let us face the reality of our frequent usage of the
`--no-verify` flag.

Eventually our hasty human nature coupled with `--no-verify` will lead us
to expensing the costly mistake of leaking credentials into a repo that is
public or *may become public in the future* - OSS for the win!.

**FACT:** We need to take the stance of not storing any credentials in git.

This post is one of a multi-part post that will be published to help us
deploy, configure and use Vault as part of our workday lives and CI systems.
This will **NOT** be a post to debate the pros and cons of other tools like
`credhub` or `lpass` and how those tools can be used to mitigate this problem.

# Install Vault via the Helm Chart
## Prep Work
1. Log into your GCP account.
1. Create a service account and restrict its access to the
   `storage.objectAdmin` role.
   - We are going to store the service account key
   in k8s as a secret. Vault will use this key to CRUD secrets into the object
store bucket.
1. Create a bucket in GCS.
   - In this example, we just named it `myteam-vault-bucket`
1. Genereate TLS certs for the ingress service so we can expose it via https.
   - Our team decided to generate certs from [LetsEncrypt](https://www.sslforfree.com/).
   - Follow the instructions to generate the cert for the appropriate domain
     and add the `TXT` record in Route 53.
1. Configure the helm chart values.
   - There are comments in the config to explain the what and why of the properties.

> ~~~yaml
# We create an Ingress service to expose vault and restrict it to https
# connections.
service:
  type: NodePort
ingress:
  enabled: true
  hosts:
  - vault.ci.cf-app.com
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.allow-http: false
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - vault.ci.cf-app.com
    # The LetsEncrypt signed certs are stored as a k8s secret as well.
    secretName: vault-tls
vault:
  # By default the Vault Helm Chart will install in dev mode. Make sure to
  # turn this `dev` mode off!!
  dev: false
  customSecrets:
  # This secret will be uploaded into k8s as part of the Installation.
  - secretName: vault-gcs-service-account
    mountPath: /vault/sa
  config:
    api_addr: "https://vault.ci.cf-app.com"
    storage:
      gcs:
        bucket: myteam-vault-bucket
        ha_enabled: \"true\"
        credentials_file: /vault/sa/key.json
~~~

## Install

```bash
export NAMESPACE_NAME="myteam-vault"
kubectl create namespace "$NAMESPACE_NAME"

kubectl create secret generic vault-gcs-service-account \
    --from-file=key.json="/tmp/sa.json" \
    --namespace "$NAMESPACE_NAME"

kubectl create secret tls vault-tls \
    --cert "/tmp/vault-tls.crt" \
    --key "/tmp/vault-tls.key" \
    --namespace "$NAMESPACE_NAME"

helm repo add incubator \
    http://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-charts-incubator

helm install incubator/vault \
    --name vault \
    --values "/tmp/helm-config-values.yml" \
    --namespace "$NAMESPACE_NAME"
```

## Other Manual Steps Required

After vault is deployed we need to manually edit the ingress service.
This will show you the ingress service.
```
kuebctl get ingresses --namespace $NAMESPACE_NAME
```
By default the name of the ingress will be `<ReleaseName>-<ChartName>` which
in this case will be `vault-vault`. If you'd like to override it, specify the
property `nameOverride` in the helm config. See
[here](https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/e64ba7aa8b2743715e0177dfc78a3a070e3a2b2d/incubator/vault/templates/_helpers.tpl#L13)
 for more details.

Edit the ingress service and remove `path: /`
```
kubectl edit ingresses vault-vault --namespace $NAMESPACE_NAME
```
More details of why we need to do this can be found in [this Github
issue](https://github.com/helm/charts/issues/6719).

## Voila!

You may now target your vault using the vault CLI at
https://vault.ci.cf-app.com

## Cleanup

- Make sure to destroy sensitive information like the service account key and
certs from your local machine.
- Remove the `TXT` record from Route 53 once the domain has propogated.

Understandably this is a bit of a üêî and ü•ö problem where we need some
secrets to stand up our secret store. We've decided to store these secrets in
LastPass.
